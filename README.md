# Predictors-of-Total-Serum-Cholesterol

#This study intended to determine the most important predictive factors of total serum cholesterol from a dataset of 19 variables that may be associated with coronary heart disease. The dataset contains information on 403 individuals. Stabilized glucose levels, high density lipoproteins (HDL), glycosylated hemoglobin, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, the ratio of cholesterol to HDL, waist measurement, and an individual’s frame were each associated with total serum cholesterol. A multiple linear regression procedure was carried out and it was found that a regression model including stabilized glucose, high-density lipoprotein, glycosylated hemoglobin, and the cholesterol to HDL ratio was the best at predicting total serum cholesterol. The final regression equation is total serum cholesterol = -89.17718 – 0.06863(stabilized glucose) + 2.85216(HDL) + 1.90887(glycosylated hemoglobin) + 33.31018(cholesterol to HDL ratio). 76.77% of the variability in total serum cholesterol is explained by this regression model. The ratio of cholesterol to HDL is the most important predictor of total serum cholesterol in the model and stabilized glucose is the least important predictor.
